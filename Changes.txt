🔧 Code & Architecture Improvements

Replaced pickle-based model loading with joblib, following scikit-learn best practices.

Fixed model serialization issues so trained models load correctly during inference.

Added proper .gitignore to exclude:

.joblib model artifacts

virtual environments

Python cache files

🖥️ Streamlit UI Integration

Added a fully functional Streamlit web interface (app.py).

Users can now:

Input environmental and sensor values

Predict PM2.5 concentration (regression)

Predict Air Quality status (classification: Good / Poor)

Integrated Hugging Face Hub model downloading directly into the app for seamless deployment.

☁️ Model Hosting & Deployment

Uploaded trained models and scaler to Hugging Face Hub.

Removed model binaries from GitHub to keep the repository lightweight.

Ensured the app dynamically downloads the latest models at runtime.

📦 Dependency & Project Cleanup

Updated requirements.txt to include:

streamlit

joblib

huggingface_hub

Improved project structure for deployment on Streamlit Cloud / Hugging Face Spaces.

🔗 Hugging Face Model Repository Link

Your trained models are stored here:

👉 https://huggingface.co/hridayeshdebsarma6/Air-Quality-Prediction-Analysis-System

This repository contains:

regression_models.joblib

classification_models.joblit

scaler.joblib

These files are automatically downloaded by the Streamlit app during runtime.
